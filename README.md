## Overview of the Project

### Project : This project is a Python-based implementation of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where a player competes against the computer. The program includes user input for choices, random computer actions, and a score-tracking system to determine the winner of each round and track overall performance.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game where the user can play multiple rounds against the computer. The program not only determines the winner of each round but also tracks the overall score for both the user and the computer, providing a more engaging and competitive experience.

### Key Activities
- **User Input and Random Computer Selection:** The user inputs their choice (rock, paper, or scissors), while the computer randomly selects its action using the random.choice() function.
- **Conditional Logic for Game Outcome:** The program uses if-elif-else statements to compare the user's choice with the computer's and determine the result of each round: win, lose, or tie.
- **Score Tracking:** Variables user_score and computer_score are used to keep track of the number of rounds won by the player and the computer, respectively.
- **Continuous Gameplay Loop:** The game runs in a loop, allowing the player to play multiple rounds until they choose to stop by entering 'n' or any key other than 'y'.
- **Displaying Results and Scores:** After each round, the program displays the result of the round and updates the scores. At the end of the game, the final score is shown before the program exits.

### Technologies Used
- **Python:** The primary programming language used to implement the game. Python’s simplicity and readability make it an ideal choice for beginners.
- **Random Module:** The built-in random module in Python is utilized to randomly select the computer's choice from the options (rock, paper, or scissors).
- **Command Line Interface (CLI):** The game is run in a command line environment, where user input is gathered and output is displayed on the console, facilitating easy interaction.
- **Basic Control Structures:** The program employs fundamental programming constructs such as loops (while loop) and conditional statements (if-elif-else) to control the flow of the game and handle user interactions.
